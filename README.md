## Hi there 👋
I recently fell in love with the art of coding that's why I'm looking forward to learn more about it so I can become a FullStack Developer. 💜

- 💻 I’m currently working as a designer and Front-end developer, both as a freelancer.
- 📱 I’m currently learning  Node.js, ReactJS and React Native.
- 💜 I’m looking to collaborate on Front-end projects with JavaScript.
- 😊 I can help with CSS, HTML, JavaScript and design.
- 💬 I'm in love with technology, Netflix and games like LoL and the Final Fantasy franchise.
